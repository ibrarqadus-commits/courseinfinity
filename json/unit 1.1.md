# Unit 1.1  
## The Road That Lies Ahead

Welcome, and well done for being here.

We’ve poured time, energy, and heart into building this programme. You showing up tells me you’re serious. So congratulations for making it to the starting line.

You’ve likely seen strategies like Rent-to-Rent, Deal Packaging, BRRR, or Serviced Accommodation. They often require big capital or rent guarantees. You carry risk. You rarely speak to owners, you deal through middlemen.

This model is different.

You won’t guarantee rent or need large start-up capital. You’ll provide a service, solving problems for owners, positioning yourself as an **Asset Manager**.

More assets under management means more predictable recurring income. Not one-off hustle.

> If you want to build wealth, solve the problems of wealthy people.

This mastermind teaches that framework. It becomes the backbone of your business, helping you build recurring income and eventually buy your own home, grow a rental portfolio, or move into development.

## Partnership Mindset

This isn’t just a course, it's a partnership. We'll build your business step by step. I'll be fair but firm.

[Coach Tone]  
My role is to bring out your best. Your role is to show up. Together, we’ll achieve results beyond what you imagine.

One property under management should cover the cost of this programme. Everything after that is profit and progress.

This is mentorship, not theory. You’ll get accountability and support along the way.

## Why You're Here

Everyone starts from a different point: job isn't fulfilling, between roles, or already running something small.

Clarity matters: where you are and where you're going.

From leading teams across three countries, I learned people leave jobs when pay is low and culture is good, or culture is toxic and pay is good. Even when both are good, ambition eventually kicks in.

You're here because you know there's more.

Your goal: build a business that gives income, control, and time freedom. You didn’t buy a course. You invested in yourself.

## Mindset Shift

Stop trading time for money.

Many waste hours online with no structure. That was the old chapter. Now we build something that pays you monthly, even when you’re not chasing deals.

Goal #1: **Secure one landlord**. One instruction covers your investment here.

With effort, discipline, and guidance, you’ll get there.

**Service. Attitude. Gratitude.** These build your reputation.

This model offers freedom. Work from home, no fancy office. Get paid fast, then monthly. It's account-based, more accounts = more income.

Protect the strategy. Share results, not the method.

## The Plan

### Step One – Build
Win instructions with confidence: scripts, outreach, credibility, checklists, real systems from London and abroad.

### Step Two – Systemise
Onboarding, fees, marketing, compliance, rent collection, maintenance, tenant vetting. Systems equal freedom.

### Step Three – Scale
Grow until revenue replaces salary, then build a business that could sell in future.

This isn’t easy. Resistance will show up. Push through it. Do hard things, life gets easier.

## Real Example

A Singapore landlord had a Canary Wharf flat. Agents treated her like a number. I stepped in, managed personally, secured tenants.

That instruction generated ~£8,000 in fees and recurring income.

Management equals resilience. Sales-only agencies struggle in downturns, but management portfolios survive.

Black Katz, where I started, is proof. Recurring income builds real business value.

## What Makes This Different

Other courses hype shiny tactics or drown you in compliance. We balance both.

You'll learn:

- Guerrilla tactics (real London playbook)
- Compliance & safety
- Targeting landlords
- Forecasting income
- Profit-first thinking
- Mindset & accountability

**Revenue is vanity, profit is sanity, cash flow is reality.**  
**Discipline bridges goals and results.**

## Who I Am (Quick)

I launched Saffron Property at 26 in Camden. Later Singapore & Kuala Lumpur. Sold to Chestertons UK in 2017. Now run multiple ventures including Sharia Homes, Bespoke Abodes London, Rock Ventures.

Everything here is tested in real markets.

**Why Guerrilla?**  
Strategy, leverage, speed, creativity. My journey started in East London market stalls. Humility, hustle, connection still guide me.

## House Rules

- Two group coaching calls weekly
- Replays in your portal
- Slack for support, ask in public channels  
- No silly questions  
- If you disappear, expect a nudge  
- We win as a group

## Your Transformation

Goal: build a profitable lettings & management business that replaces your income and eventually runs without you.

This will challenge you. Growth requires discomfort.

Show up. Follow the process. Put in the work. If you do, you will succeed.

> You already did the hardest thing, you started.

This journey leads to freedom, ownership, and control of your destiny.

Let’s get to it.
