Monty’s Letting & Management Guerrilla Business Mastermind

Step into the *Streets of London Inner Circle* and transform the way you approach property. This intensive programme is designed for professionals ready to break free from the 9–5 grind and build a self-reliant lettings and property management business that can generate consistent income and grow into a full property empire.

Led by Monty, a property industry veteran with over 25 years of experience across lettings, property management, investment, and development, this course gives you practical, step-by-step guidance on how to create, scale, and manage your property portfolio successfully. Monty’s track record includes founding *Saffron Property*, expanding internationally, managing sales for investors worldwide, and operating bespoke property ventures with trusted professional partners.

Across 7 detailed modules, you’ll gain actionable knowledge and hands-on tools to:

* Understand property as a business and plan your pathway to financial freedom.
* Attract landlords, manage tenancies, and expand your portfolio effectively.
* Master marketing strategies, high-converting property listings, and professional photography.
* Run compliant, efficient, and profitable property management operations.
* Leverage digital tools, social media, and referral networks to grow your business.
* Optimise processes to save time, reduce risk, and maximise returns.

Each module contains multiple units with practical exercises, scripts, calculators, checklists, and templates so that every insight is immediately actionable. From day one, you’ll see how a single well-executed strategy can start generating income—enough to justify your investment in the programme.

By the end of the *Guerrilla Business Mastermind*, you’ll not only have a working lettings and management business but also the confidence, systems, and professional credibility to scale it to new heights—all while staying fully compliant and in control of your growth.

This isn’t theory. This is the real-world property business, distilled, proven, and ready for you to implement.
